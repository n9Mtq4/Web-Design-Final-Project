        <h1>About This Site (Place holder index page for now)</h1>
        <p>
            This page is using the n9Mtq4 client side web framework!
            <br>
            It uses ajax for the site navigation, so you technically never leave index.html.
            <br>
            It uses a javascript client-side search engine, so you can search, and I don't have to pay to host a server.
            <br>
            How cool is that?
        </p>

        This page doesn't have content yet, but here are some demos of things.
        Most of the css and javascript is done and working, so feel free to go around and see
        how things are working for you. If there are any problems please tell me so I can fix them.
